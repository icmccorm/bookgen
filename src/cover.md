# The Beginner's Guide to Research in Computer Science

If you're interested in tackling the latest problems in computer science or in starting a career in academic publishing, this guide is for you. A mix of advice, statistics, and perspectives from students and their mentors, this guide begins at a student's perspective on day one of research and ends at the publication level, with topics including work-life balance, research skills, the peer review process, and academic publishing organizations.
